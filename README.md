# IGBT-PhysNet Output Characteristics Comparison

This repository contains large-scale output characteristic comparisons for various IGBT devices, generated as part of our research work:

**"IGBT-PhysNet: Physics Constrained Neural Network for Generalized IGBT Output Characterization Modeling"**  
(*Submitted*)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `compare_figures/`: Visualization results â€” comparison plots between measured and predicted data. Each image is named after the device model.

## ðŸ“ˆ Plot Description

Each comparison plot shows the drain current (**Id**) versus drain voltage (**Vds**) curves at different gate voltages (**Vgs**) and temperatures.  
- **Dots** represent measured data.  
- **Dashed lines** represent IGBT-PhysNet predictions.


## ðŸ”¬ Purpose

This dataset and visualization are used to validate the accuracy and generalization of IGBT-PhysNet across a wide variety of commercial IGBT devices. Each device's model name corresponds to one figure (e.g., `AIKB20NCT_compare.png`).
